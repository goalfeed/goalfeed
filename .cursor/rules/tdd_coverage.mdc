## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Write tests first for any new behavior or bug fix (Red-Green-Refactor).
- Do not add production code without a failing test that justifies it.
- Keep tests deterministic, isolated, and fast. Prefer unit tests; add integration tests when behavior spans modules.
- For UI, cover React components with React Testing Library and mock external I/O.

## Coverage Requirements

- Maintain at least 95% coverage for lines, branches, functions, and statements across affected packages.
- Enforce the threshold in the test runner configuration. Example configurations:

```ts
// Vitest (preferred)
// web/vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'jsdom',
    coverage: {
      enabled: true,
      provider: 'v8',
      all: true,
      thresholds: { lines: 95, functions: 95, branches: 95, statements: 95 },
      reportsDirectory: './coverage',
    },
    include: ['src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    exclude: ['node_modules', '.next', 'dist'],
  },
});
```

```ts
// Jest
// web/jest.config.ts
import type { Config } from 'jest';

const config: Config = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: { lines: 95, functions: 95, branches: 95, statements: 95 },
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.{ts,tsx}', '!**/node_modules/**', '!**/.next/**'],
};

export default config;
```

## Project Conventions

- Place tests alongside sources or under `__tests__` using `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`.
- For `web/` (Next.js + TypeScript):
  - Unit-test utilities in `web/src/lib/**`.
  - Component tests with React Testing Library for `web/src/components/**`.
  - Avoid relying on Next.js internals; mock router, fetch, and Supabase clients.
- For `supabase/functions/**`: write unit tests for `*.ts` logic (e.g., input validation, transformation). Integration tests may stub network.

## Automation

- Ensure `npm test` (or `pnpm test`) runs the suite with coverage and fails if thresholds are not met.
- Gate merges on green tests and >=95% coverage.

## Definition of Done (enforced by this rule)

- A failing test exists before implementation.
- Implementation makes tests pass without lowering coverage beneath 95%.
- Refactor step performed with tests remaining green.
