# Goalfeed Development Rules

## Web Frontend Auto-Compilation
When any files in the `web/frontend/src/` directory are modified:
1. Automatically run `cd web/frontend && npm run build` to recompile the React frontend
2. Restart the Goalfeed server if it's running to serve the updated frontend
3. Verify the build was successful before proceeding

## Go Backend Changes
When Go files are modified:
1. Run `go build -o goalfeed .` to compile the backend
2. If the server is running, restart it with the new binary

## API Testing
When testing API endpoints:
1. Use `curl` commands to test endpoints like `/api/games`, `/api/leagues`
2. Check that JSON responses are properly formatted
3. Verify WebSocket connections at `/ws`

## Development Workflow
- Always test changes with real API data when possible
- Use the web interface at http://localhost:8080 for visual testing
- Check server logs for any errors or warnings
- Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds before deploying

## File Organization
- Frontend code goes in `web/frontend/src/`
- Backend API code goes in `web/api/`
- League-specific services go in `services/leagues/`
- Data models go in `models/`
- Client implementations go in `clients/leagues/`
